# Test Scenario 2: Account Service - MINOR Version Bump

## Purpose
Verify that a `feat:` commit triggers a MINOR version bump (0.0.0 → 0.1.0)

## Expected Behavior
- Workflow: deploy-account.yml triggers
- Version calculation: MINOR bump
- Docker image tagged: account:0.1.0
- Git tag created: account-v0.1.0
- Deployment: staging → approval → production

## Files Changed
- This test marker file (.test-scenario-2.md)

## Success Criteria
✓ Version calculation shows MINOR bump (not PATCH)
✓ Git tag account-v0.1.0 created after build succeeds
✓ Docker image pushed with correct version
✓ Deployments succeed to staging and production
