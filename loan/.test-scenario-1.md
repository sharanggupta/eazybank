# Test Scenario 1: Loan Service - PATCH Version Bump

## Purpose
Verify that a `fix:` commit triggers a PATCH version bump (0.0.0 → 0.0.1)

## Expected Behavior
- Workflow: deploy-loan.yml triggers
- Version calculation: PATCH bump
- Docker image tagged: loan:0.0.1
- Git tag created: loan-v0.0.1
- Deployment: staging → approval → production

## Files Changed
- This test marker file (.test-scenario-1.md)

## Success Criteria
✓ Version calculation shows PATCH bump
✓ Git tag loan-v0.0.1 created after build succeeds
✓ Docker image pushed with correct version
✓ Deployments succeed to staging and production
