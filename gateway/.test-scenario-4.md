# Test Scenario 4: Gateway Service - MAJOR Version Bump

## Purpose
Verify that a `feat!:` commit (breaking change) triggers a MAJOR version bump (0.0.0 → 1.0.0)

## Expected Behavior
- Workflow: deploy-gateway.yml triggers
- Version calculation: MAJOR bump
- Docker image tagged: gateway:1.0.0
- Git tag created: gateway-v1.0.0
- Deployment: staging → approval → production

## Files Changed
- This test marker file (.test-scenario-4.md)

## Success Criteria
✓ Version calculation shows MAJOR bump (not MINOR or PATCH)
✓ New version is 1.0.0 (major version incremented)
✓ Git tag gateway-v1.0.0 created after build succeeds
✓ Docker image pushed with correct version
✓ Deployments succeed to staging and production
