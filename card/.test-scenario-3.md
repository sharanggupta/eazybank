# Test Scenario 3: Card Service - Docs Only (Skip Build)

## Purpose
Verify that documentation-only changes do NOT trigger version bumps or builds

## Expected Behavior
- Workflow: deploy-card.yml triggers
- Version calculation: SKIP (no code changes detected)
- Build: SKIPPED
- No Docker image pushed
- No git tag created

## Files Changed
- This test marker file (.test-scenario-3.md) - MARKDOWN ONLY

## Success Criteria
✓ Version calculation shows "Build Skipped for card"
✓ Version bump type: NONE
✓ No docker image pushed
✓ No git tag created
✓ No deployments triggered
